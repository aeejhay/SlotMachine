**HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Interactive Event Tool**

This project is a fully customizable Slot Machine Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to bring fun, excitement, and brand engagement to corporate events, raffles, and internal campaigns.

The interface mimics a classic slot machine, complete with animated reels, fruit icons, and a spin button that adds an interactive, casino-style experience. What makes this version unique is the ability to custom-brand the game—companies can replace the logo, colors, and theme to align with their event branding or corporate identity.

**Key Features:**

Customizable logo and visual elements for any company or brand

Engaging animation and game logic for realistic slot machine behavior

Ideal for employee raffles, event booths, giveaways, or digital promos

Lightweight and responsive for browser-based use

This game is perfect for turning company events into memorable experiences while maintaining a professional brand presence. It was created under AJEE IT SOLUTION (AJ.Mole) and is part of a growing line of interactive corporate games and tools.
